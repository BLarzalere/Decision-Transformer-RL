# Decision-Transformer-RL
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook code and output video from my Blog on Towards AI - Taking a Walk in the OpenAI Gym: Using Decision Transformer to Power Reinforcement Learning

<b>Article Summary</b>:

This article will describe how to use a decision transformer model to perform deep reinforcement learning in the OpenAI gym. PyTorch will be used as the deep learning computational framework.
