# Decision-Transformer-RL
This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook code and output video from my Blog on Towards AI - Teaching OpenAI Gym to Walk: Using Decision Transformer to Power Reinforcement Learning

<b>Article Summary</b>:

This article will describe how to use deep reinforcement learning to teach an OpenAI gym Walker to walk. The deep learning neural network will be a decision transformer, our environment will be the OpenAI gym and we'll use PyTorch as the deep learning computational framework.
